# Youtube-Spam-Comments-Detection-Analyzing-Various-Models-
In the realm of platforms like YouTube, where people watch a lot of videos for entertainment or learning, interaction between users and the creators is done through the comments section. There exists a way where people post scam comments which can be dangerous and they can include links to other pages which can hack any information or data or steal any confidential details when a link is composed on that comment. In some cases it can also redirect to the page where it attracts people to earn money while playing a game and most people have actually lost their money by clicking on such type of links displayed via comments. The purpose of this project is to classify the spam comments using several Machine Learning algorithms and then determine the best algorithm that can be used for Youtube Spam Comments detection by analysis.

This project aims to classify the spam comments on YouTube by leveraging Machine Learning algorithms to analyze and mitigate the prevalence of harmful comments containing deceptive links or fraudulent content.
This includes tasks like preprocessing the comments data, training and evaluating multiple machine learning models, and implementing strategies for cross-validation to ensure the models' accuracy and generalization. 
Additionally, the project aims to visualize the performance of each model, analyze confusion matrices to understand classification results, and explore cross-validation scores to assess model robustness.
